## Finding Data
**[The Movies Dataset:](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?select=movies_metadata.csv)**
This dataset contains metadata of 45,000 movies, listed in the Full MovieLens Dataset, released before 2018. The data is collected from TMDB and GroupLens. It is hosted on Kaggle by Rounak Banik, along with other data csv files on credits, keywords, links and ratings. There are 24 features observed including budgets, genres, release dates, revenues, and languages. This data can be used to answer the first two questions. By combining our knowledge and research on global events, the impact on movies can be determined by the dataset. Considering the dataset includes information on genres, the second question can be answered by analyzing that feature alongside revenues and ratings.

**[IMDB 5000 Movie Dataset:](https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset)**
There is no description provided by the author on how the data was collected, however, the title indicates that the information is from IMDB. The dataset is hosted on Kaggle by Yueming, a graduate student at Northeastern. There are 5,043 observations of 28 features including names of directors and actors, year, ratings, budgets, grosses, and Facebook likes. As with other datasets, by comparing to global event timelines, the impact on the movie industry can be analyzed. This information can add to the Movies Dataset by Rounak Banik, as similar data is explored.

**[IMDb Movies Extensive Database:](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset?select=IMDb+movies.csv)**
This data was scraped from the publicly available website IMDb.com using python scripts. It's hosted on Kaggle by Stefano Leone, a postgraduate student in data analytics at the National College of Ireland. In this dataset there are 85,855 observations of 22 features including title name, usa gross income, metascore ratings, and plot description. **(Not a specific answer to a question)** With this dataset, we can analyze the descriptions and genres of movies to see what kind of keywords become relevant in the context of global events.

**[The Movie Industry Dataset:](https://www.kaggle.com/danielgrijalvas/movies)**
This dataset contains information about 6280 movies from 1986 to 2016. It was taken from IMDB, and hosted by Daniel Grikalvas on Kaggle, and was created to investigate movie revenue over time. It features observations across 15 different variables including budget, gross revenue, rating, and year, which are some of the variables we need to answer the questions. Using data from this dataset, we can determine how the budgets and earnings of movies were impacted by events like the 2008 recession, and the covid-19 pandemic.
