## Finding Data
[*The Movies Dataset:*] (https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?select=movies_metadata.csv)
This dataset contains metadata of 45,000 movies, listed in the Full MovieLens Dataset, released before 2018. The data is collected from TMDB and GroupLens. It is hosted on Kaggle by Rounak Banik, along with other data csv files on credits, keywords, links and ratings. There are 24 features observed including budgets, genres, release dates, revenues, and languages. This data can be used to answer the first two questions. By combining our knowledge and research on global events, the impact on movies can be determined by the dataset. Considering the dataset includes information on genres, the second question can be answered by analyzing that feature alongside revenues and ratings.

[*IMDB 5000 Movie Dataset:*] (https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset)
There is no description provided by the author on how the data was collected. The dataset is hosted on Kaggle by Yueming, a graduate student at Northeastern. There are 5,043 observations of 28 features including names of directors and actors, year, ratings, budgets, grosses, and Facebook likes. As with other datasets, by comparing to global event timelines, the impact on the movie industry can be analyzed. This information can add to the Movies Dataset by Rounak Banik, as similar data is explored.
