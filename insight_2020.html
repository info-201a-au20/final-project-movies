      <h2>2020</h2>
      <br>
      <p class = "2020 Insights">As of the publication of this project, December 2020, there is an ongoing <b>Coronavirus Pandemic</b>. The outbreak was considered a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization in January 2020. Eventually the virus spread across the world, leading the shut downs of many stores, movie theaters, and other daily events. The economic impact the pandemic had overall was significant, causing this to be a main event and source of idea of this project.</p>
      <br>
      <p class = "2020 Insights Body">Thus far in 2020, <b>the highest rated genre is Thriller and the lowest rated genre is Mystery</b>. In popular culture, 2020 is considered to be filled with many tragedies. The similarity in the genre and daily life, may have impacted people's interest in movies. This can further be seen in the line chart reflecting searches of movies on pandemic-related topics released prior to 2020. There is <b>a boost in attention towards movies that deal with a pandemic</b> in March 2020. These search results more than double relative to November 2019 with Contagion coming in as the most different with a 9900% increase in that time frame. Assuming the similarity, perhaps the pandemic evokes people to watch movies exploring topics similar to the drastic change that they faced.</p>
      <br>
      <p class = "2020 Insights Body">In terms of financial aspects, in 2020, <b>the average budget and income decreased significantly</b> from 2019, as seen in the bar chart. Considering the closure of movie theaters due to the pandemic, economically, the movie industry struggled greatly. Without the ability to gather and film movies nor have audiences watch movies, there was a significant drop.</p>
