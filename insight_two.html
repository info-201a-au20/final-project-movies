      <br>
      <p class = "Budget Insights">Other than 1992 and 2018, the average budget of movies is in the ten millions. In our dataset, 1992 had only one movie reported with no budget. Thus in this sense, the year should be disregarded. 2018 has a budget that is significantly less than surrounding years. This is interesting since 2018 does not have a significant event that the project looks at. Considering this trend, one planning to film a movie should put aside a budget that is over ten million dollars.</p>
