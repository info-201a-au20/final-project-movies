      <h2>Budget Over the Years</h2>
      <br>
      <p class = "Finance Insights">Other than 1992 and 2018, the average budget of movies is in the ten millions. In our dataset, 1992 had only one movie reported with no budget. Thus in this sense, the year should be disregarded. 2018 has a budget that is significantly less than surrounding years, as well as an extraordinarily greater average revenue. This is interesting since 2018 does not have a significant event that the project looks at. However, looking at the total revenue brought in in the year 2018, we can see that the total revenue is comparable to the total revenue brought in in 2019. This would suggest that 2018 had a low number of movies produced, with a few high-grossing movies that would bring up the average. Considering the trends we found in the finances of the movie industry, one planning to film a movie should put aside a budget that is over ten million dollars.</p>
