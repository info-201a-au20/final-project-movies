      While we tried to be as accurate as possible, there are some limitations to the analysis we performed on our data.
      </p>
      <p><b>About the overall project</b>, we disregarded inflation of currency, as <i>it would complicate the analysis with more . Nevertheless, we realize that inflation can greatly affect the currency value in the long term. That is because even though the inflation rate in the US since 1990 has been averaging at 2.5% (according to Statista), the aggregated price can at most nearly double with 99.2% increase for prices in 1990 to be converted to 2020. This is a limiations that we wish to improve in later version of the application</i>. Additionally, movie production takes a few years to occur, so themes prevalent in global events are not instantaneously reflected in movies that are released during that time period. Furthermore, while we made sure each of our observations had a reported USA gross income, some did not report a budget.

        For the <b>scatterplot visualization</b> specifically, the datapoints are somewhat crowded and some of the colors used to identify the movie genre are quite similar and difficult to distinguish. However, color palettes did not contain enough different colors for all of the movie genres, and because the scatterplot is interactive, hovering over datapoints will allow for clearer views of the data they represent. Selections checkbox can also help with clarity. 
        </p>
        <p>
For the <b>bar chart</b>, one of the limitations is that we calculated the average revenue by year, rather than the median. This could potentially allow values to be skewed by outliers of movies that earned extremely high or extremely low amounts of revenue.
