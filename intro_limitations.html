      While we tried to be as accurate as possible, there are some limitations to the analysis we performed on our data.

      <p>
        <b>Regarding the overall analysis</b>, we disregarded inflation of currency due to time constraints, as inflation calculations would have included the usage of another dataset about inflation rates. Nevertheless, we realize that inflation can greatly affect the currency value in the long run. That is because even though the inflation rate in the US since 1990 has been averaging at 2.5% (data from to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/191077/inflation-rate-in-the-usa-since-1990/"><i>Statista</i></a>), from 1990 to 2020, the aggregated price can almost double at 99.2% (<a href="https://www.usinflationcalculator.com"><i>US inflation calculator</i></a>). This is a limitation that we would aim to improve in later versions of the application. Additionally, movie production takes a few years to finish, so significant events are not likely to be instantaneously reflected in movies that are released during those events' times of occurence. However, with limited knowledge, we could not make proper inferences about this analysis.

          <b>Regarding the datasets we use</b>, there are a few data pieces that are missing or currently unavailable. While we made sure each of our observations had a reported USA gross income, some did not report a budget. We also found that not every year in our dataset has a representation of each genre. Furthermore, the data for 2020 is not complete since the year has not yet concluded as of the time of publication. Many movies are released during holiday seasons, which are more clustered towards the end of the year. As a result, we currently cannot provide definite data evidence about number of movies coming out in 2020 and how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected it.
