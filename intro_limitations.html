      While we tried to be as accurate as possible, there are some limitations to the analysis we performed on our data.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>About the overall analysis</b>, we disregarded inflation of currency, as the calculation would include the usage of another dataset about inflation rate, but due to time constraint, we were unable to do so. Nevertheless, we realize that inflation can greatly affect the currency value in the long term. That is because even though the inflation rate in the US since 1990 has been averaging at 2.5% (data from to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/191077/inflation-rate-in-the-usa-since-1990/"><i>Statista</i></a>), the aggregated price can at most nearly double with 99.2% increase for prices in 1990 to be converted to 2020 (<a href="https://www.usinflationcalculator.com"><i>US inflation calculator</i></a>). This is a limiations that we wish to improve in later version of the application. Additionally, movie production takes a few years to finish, so global events are not likely to instantaneously reflected in movies that are released during those events' times of occurence. However, with limited knowledge, we could not make proper inference about this analysis. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Regarding the datasets we use</b>, there were a few data pieces that are missing or currently unavailable. While we made sure each of our observations had a reported USA gross income, some did not report a budget. Furthermore, the data for 2020 is not complete since the year has not yet concluded as of when the data for this project is found. To add more to that, many movies are released during holiday seasons, which are more cluttered towards the end of the year. As a result, we unfortunately can not yet provide a definite data evidence about number of movies coming out in 2020 and how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected it.
        </p>
        <p>
        For the <b>scatterplot visualization</b>, some years did not have movies from each genre in our dataset. Therefore, we are unable to compare the popularity of every single movie genre in every year from 1990 to 2020. However, we still have enough data points to analyze and get meaningful genre popularity insights .
        </p>
        <p>
For the <b>bar chart</b>, one of the limitations is that we calculated the average revenue by year, rather than the median. This could potentially allow values to be skewed by outliers of movies that earned extremely high or extremely low amounts of revenue.
