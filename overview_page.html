        Movies have been an important aspect of society since their creation. While they are commonly perceived as entertainment, they are also an art form and a way to portray issues that reflect our culture and current events. As a society, we have been witnessing the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the movie industry, from movie theater closures to film releases being delayed or pushed straight to streaming services. This project seeks to investigate the impact that global events - including the COVID-19 pandemic - have had on a variety of factors within the movie industry. The movie data from this project is mainly taken from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset?select=IMDb+movies.csv">IMDb Movies Extensive Database</a>, suplemented with the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset">IMDB 5000 Movie Dataset</a>. The analysis for the pandemic movies' resurgance also uses data from <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends">Google Trends</a> to learn more about people's interest in those movies through Google search counts.
