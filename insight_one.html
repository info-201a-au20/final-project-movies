      <h2>Genres Over the Years</h2>
      <br>
      <p class = "Genre Insights">While our project focuses on the years <b>1991, 1997, 2001, 2005, 2008, and 2020</b>, there are interesting trends to look at throughout the overall time period (1991-2020). Firstly, the most common genre of released movies is <b>Drama</b>. Specifically from <em>1993 to 2015</em>, Drama is the most common genre during the year. Thus, those planning to film a movie in the near future should consider a Drama movie to best fit in with the common movies. In terms of least common genre, the types of genres vary across different years. However, it seems that <b>History</b> movies are rare. </p>
