      <br>
      <p class = "Genre Insights">While our project focuses on the years <b>1991, 1997, 2001, 2005, 2008, and 2020</b>, there are interesting trends to look at throughout the overall time period (1991-2020). Firstly, the most common genre of released movies is <b>Drama</b>. Specifically from <em>1993 to 2015</em>, <b>Drama</b> is the most common genre during the year. Thus, those planning to film a movie in the near future should consider a Drama movie to best fit in with the common movies. In terms of least common genre, the types of genres vary across different years. However, it seems that History movies are rare. [insert image]</p>
