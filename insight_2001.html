      <p class = "2001 Insights">The world, and specifically the United States faced an unexpected tragedy September 11, 2001 when <b>there was a terrorist attack on the Twin Towers</b>. This lead to thousands of deaths and tens of thousands of injuries. Overall, the 9/11 attacks changed the thinking of citizens. Considering the impact the event had, the project looked into this event and its influence on the movie industry.</p>
      <br>
      <p class = "2001 Insights Body">In 2001, the <b> highest rated genre was Musical and the lowest rated genre was Sports</b>. This is interesting because in 2001, Musical was the <b>least common genre of movies</b>. Often, music is what people look to when they struggle to express their emotions or experience anxiety. Perhaps even in movies, people were looking to relieve their stress and anxiety following the attacks. </p>
      <br>
      <p class = "2001 Insights Body">There were <b>no significant changes</b> in terms of number of movies released, and other financial aspects of the movie industry during this year. While this suggests that the 9/11 attacks did not have much of an impact on the movie industry, it is important to note that the attacks occurred late in the year. The span of three months may not have had significant impact that showed in the data.</p>
