      <h3>2008</h3>
      <br>
      <p class = "2008 Insights">Due to the "Subprime Mortgage Crisis", the United States and Western Europe experience <b>the Great Recession</b> from late 2007 to mid-2009. The economic depression changed how people spend money and lived daily. Since the entire year of 2008 was in this period, it was observed to see the impact on the movie industry.</p>
      <br>
      <p class = "2008 Insights Body">In terms of genre, <b>the lowest rated genre in 2008 was Fantasy</b>. In a time of high stress and economic struggle, perhaps people were not interested nor impressed in viewing fantasy movies. Rather they were working hard to take in and solve the reality.</p>
      <br>
      <p class = "2008 Insights Body">Interestingly, there were <b>no significant changes</b> in terms of financial aspects of the movie industry during this year. While our data does deal with the average value in the year, there seems to be no significant economic impact on the movie industry.</p>
